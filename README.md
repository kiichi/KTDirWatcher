KTDirWatcher
===============

A Directory Monitoring Windows Service that works with Loggly Cloud Service API. For implementation, see https://github.com/kiichi/KTDirWatcher/blob/master/KTDirWatcher/MainService.cs


If you need to monitor only one level (e.g. top level of public web folder), change recursive option and type.
